First attempt at making a game using the libgdx library on Android. Should work multiplatform.

Note: Most likely will only be fully functional on the Android - tested on S4 (different resolutions untested). 

To get it working you need to clone this repo, and import the android folder as an android project (or android code) using the Android IDE (eclipse). Then link the source (by right clicking the project --> properties -> Java build path -> Link/Attach Source) of the core project (under the core folder).

You should now be able to build and deploy it on your phone/simulator!
